# **Ethereal – A Tranquil Way to Stay Focused** ✨  
*Built on Ethereum for Hacklahoma 2025*  

## **🌿 Overview**  
**Ethereal** is a **calm and mindful** productivity tool designed to help you **stay focused** while working or studying. Instead of letting distractions take over, you commit to a focus session by **staking ETH** into a **smart contract**.  

- If you **complete your session**, you get your **stake back + optional NFT rewards**.  
- If you **exit early**, a portion of your stake is forfeited, reinforcing **intentional time management**.  

**Ethereal** is built for **Hacklahoma 2025**, leveraging **Ethereum smart contracts, Layer 2 scaling, and NFT incentives** to create a **serene and effective focus experience**.  

---

## **✨ Features**  
✅ **Commit to Focus with ETH** – Stake a small amount of ETH to start a session.  
✅ **Earn Back Your Stake** – Stay focused and reclaim your ETH at the end.  
✅ **Break Distraction Cycles** – If you leave early, a **penalty is applied**.  
✅ **NFT Rewards** (Optional) – Complete streaks and earn relaxing **Ethereal NFTs**.  
✅ **Layer 2 Compatible** – Reduce gas fees using **Optimism or Arbitrum**.  
✅ **Decentralized & Transparent** – Powered by Ethereum, fully on-chain.
